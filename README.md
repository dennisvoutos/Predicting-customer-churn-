This is my personal Capstone Project that i did for my Masters. It involves using a machine learning model with random forest classification to predict whether a customer will churn from a bank or not. The dataset used can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn/data
Running the react app will give you in interface, and when submitting the data an API call is done to send that data to the python server, which in turn returns the prediction. The python server is done using flask.
